We present the Curse of Depth, a phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) where deeper layers contribute less effectively to training due to the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). Our analysis identifies this issue as a key bottleneck in LLM optimization and proposes LayerNorm Scaling as a solution to mitigate its impact.

## Abstract

In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less
effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically,
identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its
output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training.
To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training.

## Caveat 

Combining LNS with Scaled Initialization used by most LLM training frameworks (which scales the initialization of W0 and W2 by the overall depth $1/\sqrt{2L}$, or something similar) diminishes the effectiveness of LNS. This highlights the importance of eliminating conflicting initialization strategies before adopting LNS.

## Hugging Face
We have uploaded the trained weights for the 1B model using LayerNorm Scaling (LNS). 
You can download them from [https://huggingface.co/pengxiang/LNS_1B].

## Quick Start

### Install experiment dependencies

You can configure the environment using the following command lines:

```bash
conda create -n LNS python=3.9 -y
conda activate LNS
pip install -r exp_requirements.txt
```

### Training Examples
We provide scripts to train models of different sizes using Pre-LN, Post-LN, Mix-LN, and LayerNorm Scaling (LNS).

Train a 130M Model:
```bash
bash run_130m.sh pre      3   # Pre-LN
bash run_130m.sh post     3   # Post-LN
bash run_130m.sh post_pre 3   # Mix-LN
bash run_130m.sh LNS      3   # LayerNorm Scaling (LNS)

(Note: 3 represents the number of Post-LN layers in Mix-LN.)
```


Train a 250M Mode:
```bash
bash run_250m.sh pre      6   # Pre-LN
bash run_250m.sh post     6   # Post-LN
bash run_250m.sh post_pre 6   # Mix-LN
bash run_250m.sh LNS      6   # LayerNorm Scaling (LNS)

(Note: 6 represents the number of Post-LN layers in Mix-LN.)
```

Train a 350M Mode:
```bash
bash run_350m.sh pre      6   # Pre-LN
bash run_350m.sh post     6   # Post-LN
bash run_350m.sh post_pre 6   # Mix-LN
bash run_350m.sh LNS      6   # LayerNorm Scaling (LNS)
```

Train a 1B Mode:
```bash
bash run_1b.sh pre        6   # Pre-LN
bash run_1b.sh post       6   # Post-LN
bash run_1b.sh post_pre   6   # Mix-LN
bash run_1b.sh LNS        6   # LayerNorm Scaling (LNS)
```

### Performance Drop
Calculate the performance drop after removing different layers. We use [lm_eval](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) to obtain evaluation results. Please refer to its installation instructions to configure `lm_eval``.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness
cd lm-evaluation-harness
pip install -e .
```

Then, you can run the following command to remove different layers and save the weights to a new model. The performance drop will be calculated based on the new model:
```bash
# LLaMA2-7B, Remove Layer 1
python layer_remove.py \
    --model_path meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf \
    --layer_index 1 \
    --save_path ./llama_7b_removed_1
```
